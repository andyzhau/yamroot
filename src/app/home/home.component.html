<h1>What are the health benefits of wild yam?</h1>
<p>
  Wild yam is a plant that people have used for centuries in alternative
  medicine. Potential medicinal uses for wild yam include the treatment of
  menopause symptoms, rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes, and muscular cramps.
</p>
<p>
  There are various other names for wild yam, such as colic root, devil's bones,
  rheumatism root, or China root. While there are over 600 species of wild yam,
  only 12 are edible.
</p>

<p>
  In this article, we investigate the potential medicinal uses of wild yam and
  the evidence supporting them. We also look at how to take it and its safety
  and side effects.
</p>

<h2>Benefits and uses</h2>
<p>
  The bulb and roots of wild yams contain a chemical called diosgenin, which can
  influence the production of several useful hormones in humans, such as
  estrogen
  or dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA). Consuming wild yam may be a natural way of
  promoting these hormones in the body, which could have certain medical
  benefits.
</p>
<p>
  However, at present, there is little evidence to support any medical
  applications of wild yam. The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
  have yet to evaluate wild yam for its safety or effectiveness.
</p>
<p>Some of the potential medical uses of wild yam include:</p>

<h3>Menopause symptoms</h3>
<p>Some traditional medicine practitioners suggest using wild yam as an
  alternative to estrogen replacement therapy for treating symptoms of
  menopause. The theory is that wild yam may increase or stabilize estrogen
  levels in the body to help relieve a person's symptoms.
</p>
<p>However, there is very little evidence to support these claims. One of the
  only studies available on the topic found that the 23 women who applied a wild
  yam cream over a 3-month period experienced no changes in their menopausal
  symptoms.</p>

<h3>Rheumatoid arthritis</h3>
<p>Some traditional medicine practitioners believe that wild yam has
  anti-inflammatory properties and use it to treat rheumatoid arthritis.</p>
<p>Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic condition that causes inflammation of the
  joints. This can cause pain and stiffness that restricts mobility in people
  with the condition.</p>
<p>It is possible that wild yam might reduce this inflammation and have a
  positive effect on symptoms, but there is little evidence to support this.</p>

<h3>Blood sugar regulation</h3>
<p>Wild yam also contains a chemical called dioscoretine, which some people
  think helps with the regulation of blood sugar levels. Wild yam could be
  useful in regulating blood sugar levels in people with diabetes. However, the
  effect of dioscoretine on blood sugar has only been studied in animals so far.
  It is unclear whether it would have the same effect in humans.
</p>

<h3>Cramps and muscular pain</h3>
<p>Other proponents of wild yam, believe that it has anti-spasmodic properties,
  which are substances that reduce muscle spasms. This anti-spasmodic property
  means that wild yam might be useful for reducing cramps and muscular pain
  related to premenstrual syndrome (PMS), for example. However, more research is
  needed to support this.</p>

<h2>How to take wild yam</h2>
<p>Consuming wild yam is rare due to its bitter taste. However, it is available
  in a variety of formulations, including:</p>
<ul>
  <li>tablet</li>
  <li>capsule</li>
  <li>tincture</li>
  <li>cream</li>
  <li>tea</li>
  <li>powder</li>
</ul>
<p>Many of these formulations of wild yam are available to purchase online.</p>
<p>How much wild yam to take depends on several factors, such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li>the person's health condition</li>
  <li>the person's age</li>
  <li>the formulation of the wild yam</li>
</ul>
<p>However, scientific studies have yet to determine a safe and effective dosage
  range for wild yam. It is therefore essential to consult a medical
  professional
  before taking wild yam. Always read the packaging carefully before using.</p>

<h2>Safety and side effects</h2>
<p>The FDA have not yet evaluated wild yam for its medicinal use, so there is
  little detailed information on its safety or side effects.The FDA have not yet
  evaluated wild yam for its medicinal use, so there is little detailed
  information on its safety or side effects.</p>
<p>Wild yam is a natural substance, but this does not mean it is free from side
  effects. In small doses, wild yam is considered safe for most people. However,
  large amounts of wild yam can lead to side effects, including:

</p>
<ul>
  <li>nausea</li>
  <li>vomiting</li>
  <li>headaches</li>
  <li>digestive issues</li>
</ul>
<p>Some people may also have an allergic reaction to wild yam. For example, wild
  yam may cause skin irritation when applied as cream.</p>
<p>People who have hormone-sensitive conditions, such as breast cancer or
  uterine fibroids, should not use wild yam. It is possible for wild yam to
  influence estrogen production and worsen the condition.</p>
<p>There is also insufficient evidence about whether wild yam is safe during
  pregnancy, breast-feeding, or for young children. For this reason, doctors
  recommend people avoid using wild yam during these times.</p>
<p>Wild yam has been shown to interact with certain medications. For example, it
  can interact with estradiol, which is a substance used in certain birth
  control
  pills or hormone replacement therapies.</p>
<p>There may be other medications that wild yam can interact with, but further
  investigation is needed. It is essential to consult a doctor before taking
  wild yam to ensure it is safe for use.</p>

<h2>Outlook</h2>
<p>Although traditional medicine practitioners use wild yam to treat a variety
  of health conditions, further research is needed to determine its safety and
  effectiveness.

</p>
<p>Wild yam may interact with other medications, and consuming large amounts can
  lead to side effects. It is, therefore, necessary to speak to a doctor before
  taking wild yam.
